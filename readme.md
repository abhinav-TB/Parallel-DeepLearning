# Parallel Deep Learning

This repository contains code for a neural network implementation that uses parallelism to speed up forward propagation. The neural network is implemented in C++ and uses OpenMP for parallelization.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler that supports OpenMP
- OpenMP library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/Parallel-DeepLearning.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd Parallel-DeepLearning`
3. Compile the code: `g++ -fopenmp main.cpp neural_network.cpp -o main`
4. Run the program: `./main`

## Implementation Details

The neural network is implemented using a vector of layer vectors and a vector of weight matrices. The number of nodes in each layer is specified by the user when creating the neural network object. The weight matrices are initialized with random values between 0 and 1.

The neural network uses forward propagation to make predictions. The input layer is set using the `setInputLayer` method, and the output layer can be obtained using the `getOutputLayer` method. The `feedForward` method performs forward propagation and updates the values in each layer.

Parallelism is achieved using OpenMP. The `feedForward` method is parallelized using the `omp parallel for` directive, which distributes the work across multiple threads. The number of threads used by the neural network can be controlled using the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable.


## Performance

The parallel implementation of the neural network can provide significant speedup over the serial implementation, especially for large neural networks. The exact speedup depends on the specific hardware and workload. Here are some example performance results:

| Neural Network Size                    | Serial Time (s)| Parallel Time (s) | Speedup |
|----------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| 2-3-1                                  | 0.1521         | 0.1431            | 1.06x   |
| 2-1000-1000-1000-1                     | 0.0385         | 0.0270            | 1.42x   |
| 2-1000-1000-1000-1000-1000-1000-1000-1 | 0.1055         | 0.0419            | 2.51x   |

These results were obtained on a system with an Intel Core i5-9300H CPU and 4 physical cores. The neural network was trained on a single input-output pair.

Note that the exact performance results may vary depending on the specific hardware and workload. You may need to experiment with different neural network sizes and input-output pairs to find the optimal performance for your system.
